Time Management and Personal Organization
Awareness of time spent on homework by subject, and potentially assignment
Enter a estimated time, and use a combination of stopwatch and self-reporting to find the amount of inaccuracy in the userâ€™s perception
Using that data, we give them a column which reports a calibrated estimate of how long it will take to do the assignment
We track user-misconception across subjects and possibly assignment types to calibrate the hours for all assignments
Color code assignments by predicted time so they can prioritize at a glance.
